Q3AS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Quake 3 Advanced Server rewrite using baseq3a from -ec, and also using Osp fork found on github.
This version of Q3 has team balance implemented within it, settable within the cfg files, causing forced balance of teams based on the number you set within the cfg.
Also, while using baseq3a as a base, this also has various security fixes along with unlagged feature which was done in the baseq3a repo.
